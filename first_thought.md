# First Thoughts

On the bus ride over to the conferece, I realized that it's been nearly six months since my last major developers conference. I did spend half a day at OpenAgile NW, but it reminded me so much of the conversations we have at work (we were attempting ti implement Agile methodologies) that I felt like I was having the same fight over and over again.

My last major conference was Strangeloop. I learned so much at that conference, both about code and about myself. I'm excited to discover what I might learn at WWConnect. Of course, I'm already running a little late. (When you're perpetually exhausted, you tend to oversleep.) but I'm on the bus and on my way. I'm excited and terrified and happy all at the same time.
